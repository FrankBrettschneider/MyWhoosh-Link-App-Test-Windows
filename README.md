The script checks the network connection between MyWhoosh on Windows and your mobile phone. It doesnÂ´t change anything in your network setting. It just tests whether the software provides the needed ports.
You have to know the ip of your mobile. You can find it on network information in the mobile's wifi menue.

1. Start MyWhoosh
2. Switch to powershell (MyWhoosh runs in backround)
3. Start the script
4. wait a minute until the network port tests have finished
5. the result is displayed on screen and stored to file.

If the test looks like this, the connection is not possible.
